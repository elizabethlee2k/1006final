    <h1>Thoughts on Some Books I've Read This Year</h1>
    <h3><i>The Bluest Eye</i> by Toni Morrison</h3>
    <p>Chronicling young Pecola Breedlove’s pregnancy and how it happened, this book illustrates what it means to be black in America, as well as the consequences of American culture defining beauty as white. Morrison tells a story about individuals that says something about society in general. The characters are often relatable and each interaction contains meaning. Her language is both precise and poetic. Definitely would recommend it. </p>
    <h3><i>Killing Commendatore</i> by Haruki Murakami</h3>
    <p>About a portrait painter whose marriage ends and he moves to an isolated mountain. This book is based on the Great Gatsby, I’m told, but it also mixes in surreal elements and hecka symbolism. It is calming to read, almost dreamlike, but also an adventure. Would recommend. </p>
    <h3><i>Uncommon Type</i> by Tom Hanks</h3>
    <p>**Disclaimer: I have not finished this one** “Tom Hanks, like the actor?” you ask. “He writes books?” Well, now he does. The strengths of this short story collection are the realistic details and unexpected moments of humor. Would recommend. </p>
    <h3><i>Where the Crawdads Sing</i> by Delia Owens</h3>
    <p>This book has become hugely popular on Goodreads and book reccomendation lists, but I personally don't think its worth the hype. The pros of the books are the descriptions of nature and the intriguing mystery, but it also glorifies being abandonded and isolated and being a special snowflake manic pixie dream girl. The relationships in the story are cliche and based in fantasy. Probably would not reccomend.</p>
