    <p>Some Books I Have Read In The Last Year and My Thoughts On Them</p>
    <p><i>The Bluest Eye</i> by Toni Morrison</p>
    <p>This book is incredibly well written. One thing I like about this book is that each of the characters represents something larger than themselves, but they are still realistic and individual.</p>
    <p><i>Killing Commendatore</i> by Haruki Murakami </p>
    <p>This book is based on the Great Gatsby, I’m told, but it also mixes in some surreal aspects and hecka symbolism. Unlike The Bluest Eye the characters are not individualized, the protagonist’s sister, wife and child friend all have the same spirit, but that is the point, since he is comparing them to make sense of their roles in his life. </p>
    <p><i>Uncommon Type</i> by Tom Hanks</p>
    <p>**Disclaimer: I have not finished this one** “Tom Hanks, like the actor?” you ask. “He writes books?” Well, now he does. Tom Hank’s strengths in this short story collection are his abilities to write realistically and his humorous details.</p>
